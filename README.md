My journey towards becoming a programmer

Here you can take a look at all the way I've come. Everything started with programming logic and Portugol WebStudio.
Now (March 2022) I'm about to start studying SQL. While I wait for my classes to resume I'm watching some videos on Git and GitHub, Python and Java.
As soon as possible I also want to turn all my .por files into .py and .java ones :)
