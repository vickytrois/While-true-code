My journey towards becoming a programmer

Here you can take a look at all the way I've come. Everything started with programming logic and Portugol WebStudio.
In March 2022, I started studying SQL. While I wait for my classes to resume I watched some videos on Git and GitHub, Python and Java.
As soon as possible I also want to turn all my .por files into .py and .java ones :)

June 2022 and some months have passed since I first entered info here. Since then, I've seen some aspects of non-relational DB with MongoDB, started learning HTML, CSS and JS, and have been admitted to course System Analisys and Development at the Federal Institute here in my state.
Hope the next 3 months are as exciting as these past 3 have been.
